## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
- RESTful routes 

The client/server relationship is a prerequisite of a set of principles known as REST(representational state transfer) which provides a way of mapping HTTP verbs ( get, post, put, delete) and CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) together.

- json

is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).
JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. JSON filenames use the extension .json.

- API

An application programming interface (API) was originally understood to be an application specific computing interface exposed by a particular software program or operating system to allow third parties to extend the functionality of that software application beyond its capabilities as they existed out of the box.[1] Such extensions still operated within the confines of that software application.

- Endpoints

Endpoints are remote computing devices that connect to a network and communicates back and forth with the network. 

- Strong params

It provides an interface for protecting attributes from end-user assignment. This makes Action Controller parameters forbidden to be used in Active Model mass assignment until they have been explicitly enumerated.
